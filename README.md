## Description
This is a small web app to play some of the coding challenges as games.<br>
Tech Stack: <b>```JavaScript, ReactJS, HTML5, CSS ```</b>
<br>
Online Presence: Click <b>[Here](https://code-challenges.herokuapp.com/)</b> to play them.
<br>
<br>

## Userflow
- Simply access the site online and play them for your refreshment.
- For Guess a Number Game, you have to click on the button to open up the game.
- To play the game of Palindrome, simple enter a word and submit it.
<br>
<br>


## Tests
- The tests are written using react testing library. Some tests are smoke tests(To test if the component is rendered
correctly). Some tests are SnapShot tests(To test if the rendering actually changed).
- If the ShapShot test fails, re-run the test.<br>
- To run tests locally:<br>
&nbsp; &ensp; &emsp; -  ```npm test``` OR <br>
&nbsp; &ensp; &emsp; - ```npm run test``` <br>
&nbsp; &ensp; &emsp; - ```npm test -- --coverage``` for code coverage <br>

## To Simulate the Project
- Clone the github repo for the project.
- Go to your cloned directory, type ```code .``` and hit Enter to open the project in VSCode.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &ensp; &ensp; &emsp; - Simultaneously press ```Ctrl``` and ``` ` ```(back tick) keys to open up the terminal in VSCode editor. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &ensp; &ensp; &emsp; - Run the command ```npm init``` to install the dependencies. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &ensp; &ensp; &emsp; -   Then run ```npm start``` to run the project locally

# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
